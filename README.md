# grunt-starterkit

It's a simple starter kit with GruntJS.

## Install Dependencies

```shell
> npm install
```

## Develop

We can now develop JS/HTML/CSS with the starter kit. Just run GruntJS

```shell
> grunt
```

and it's now listening to the project files, and when changed it's transpiled to distribution directory, dist.
